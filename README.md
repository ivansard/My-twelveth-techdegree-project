# My-twelveth-techdegree-project

The app represents a festival guide. Users can sign up, submit their favorite artist and favorite music genres and based on that they can get recommendations for festivals they might like to attend. In addition, they can also ask questions about certain festivals, and vote out the best answers for a particular question.

The frontend was developed with Bootstrap, the backend was handled by Express, and data was stored with MongoDB, in particular Mongoose, as the MongoDB branch for Node.js

The app connects to two APIs:
* The Flickr API, to fetch photos for a particular festival
* The Fixer API, to fetch conversion rates, in order to display festival ticket prices in multiple currencies

//FOR TREEHOUSE REVIEWERS

I went with my own idea for the project, I hope that isn't an issue, since the project ideas were stated at the bottom of the project requirements
